Movie,Review,Source
Thor: Ragnarok,"Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while.",The New York Times
Thor: Ragnarok,"Daft as a badger sandwich and twice as funny, this is vintage Waititi, and the boldest, most outrageously fun film Marvel has yet produced.",Empire
Thor: Ragnarok,"Waititi emerges triumphant, but it’s a nail-biter.",New York Post
Thor: Ragnarok,"The movie sucks.Even though that movie was a blockbuster, I was bored by the story.I think all the impressive parts are in the trailer, don’t waste your time and money to go to the cinema. I’m tired of the non-stop Marvel style joke...","User: 
DCDOG"
Thor: The Dark World,"The larger problem, transcending all realms, is that this action-adventure sequel from Marvel soon turns so dumb and 3-D-murky that it hurts.",The Wall Street Journal
Thor: The Dark World,"This is a deeply silly, extremely noisy and sometimes impenetrable action movie that’s drowning in CGI, wild overacting and mullets. And it’s enormously entertaining.",Time Out London
Thor: The Dark World,No amount of tool-wielding heroism can save The Dark World from being a startlingly unbalanced movie.,The Guardian
Thor: The Dark World,"So how's this ""Thor"" sequel? It's fairly entertaining. Same old threats of galaxy annihilation, spiced with fish-out-of-water jokes. ",Chicago Tribune
Thor,"The year's most divided movie to date; everything that happens in the higher realms, vaguely derived from Nordic legend, is posturing nonsense, whereas the scenes down here are managed, for the most part, with dexterity and wit.",The New Yorker
Thor,"Like Thor's hammer, this ersatz epic bludgeons its victims into submission.",The Wall Street Journal
Thor,"The last 25 minutes of Thor aren't much better than the first. But that hour in between - tasty, funny, robustly acted - more than compensates. ",Chicago Tribune
Thor,"At its best moments, Thor weaves a spot of magic from the complex science of $150-million fantasy-film technology. ",Time
