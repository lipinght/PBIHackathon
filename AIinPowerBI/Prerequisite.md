# AML Intergration Lab Prerequisite 

* Only run this prerequisite step if you are doing the AML integration lab.
* If you already have an available Azure Machine Learning workspace and a computer instance, ignore this step.

## Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace

In the Azure portal, create a new Machine Learning resource, specifying the following settings:

* Subscription: Your Azure subscription
* Resource group: Create or select a resource group
* Workspace name: Enter a unique name for your workspace
* Region: West Europe
* Storage account: Note the default new storage account that will be created for your workspace
* Key vault: Note the default new key vault that will be created for your workspace
* Application insights: Note the default new application insights resource that will be created for your workspace
* Container registry: None (one will be created automatically the first time you deploy a model to a container)

Once deployment is successful, go to the overview page of the machine learning resource, and click **Launch Studio**

## Create a compute instance

In Azure Machine Learning studio, view the Compute page. On the Compute instances tab, add a new compute instance with the following settings. Youâ€™ll use this as a workstation to run code in notebooks.

* Compute name: enter a unique name
* Location: West Europe
* Virtual machine type: CPU
* Virtual machine size: Standard_DS11_v2
* Total Available Quotas: This shows dedicated cores available.
* Show advanced settings: Note the following settings, but do not select them:
* Enable SSH access: Unselected (you can use this to enable direct access to the virtual machine using an SSH client)
* Enable virtual network: Unselected (you would typically use this in an enterprise environment to enhance network security)
* Assign to another user: Unselected (you can use this to assign a compute instance to a data scientist) 3.Wait for the compute instance to start and its state to change to Running.
