## Description

Previously in Power BI Desktop, when you used a DirectQuery in a report, no other data connections, whether DirectQuery or import, were allowed for that report. With composite models, that restriction is removed. A report can seamlessly include data connections from more than one DirectQuery or import data connection, in any combination you choose.
Doing this series of hands-on labs, you will learn how to connect with Direct Query to a Power BI dataset in the cloud and then how to create, add relationships, columns, measures, refresh and publish a composite model.
